- What make this model good candidate:

K-Nearest Neighbors - NO:
- Real wold application:
- Strengths/when perform well: When data set is small, noise-free, all labeled
- Weaknesses/when perform poorly: Slow when data set is big or high-demensional
- What make this model good candidate: No training, instance-based, one hyperparameter
